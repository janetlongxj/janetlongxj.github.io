Born in Kunming, China. Live in Montreal, Canada since 2017.

I love art, travelling, collecting postcard, food... and trying new things.
The most recent hobby: collective gardening

Speaking: Mandarin, English, French, Japanese (a bit)

About career: I am working in tunnel engineering. Also some infrastructural project like bridges, underground structures, industrial facilities...

My favorite people in the world: my mom and my dad. They support me, teach me, love me. I will never lose hope because of their presence.
