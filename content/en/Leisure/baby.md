2. Page Bundle Method

- Create a folder for your post
- Name your image `cover.*`
- Place it in the same folder as your content
- Set the alt text in your post frontmatter

### Place The Cover

You can place your featured images in various layout, anywhere on article content with `{{</* figure */>}}` shortcode:

```toml
{{</* figure src="cover" caption="alt" */>}}
```

This is freedom of authoring!

{{< figure src="cover" caption="alt" >}}
